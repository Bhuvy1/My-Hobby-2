			<h2>coding is a computer language to create advanced apps, games and many more. coding can increase your thinking skills and logic too.Without it, we’d have none of the most popular technology we’ve come to rely on such as Facebook, our smartphones, the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code.Coding is a skill where you take instructions (the steps in a task) and translate it into a language the computer understands since computers do not communicate like humans. They communicate in a language called BINARY and it is uses 0's and 1's. Coders write the instructions using a programming language.
